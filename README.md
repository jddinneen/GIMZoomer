# GIMZoomer
GIMZoomer is a work-in-progress software for viewing local folder structures and flexiby simplifying the displayed tree of those folders.
It implements a simplification algorithm tested with other kinds of knowledge structures (Julien, Tirilly, Dinneen & Guastavino, 2013; Dinneen, Asadi, Frissen, Shu & Julien, 2018), and will be used in a study to evaluate if it has advantages when retrieving information from group-managed information structures (e.g. institutional shared drives).

Most code written by Jwen Fai Low.
